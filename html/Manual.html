		<h1>The Abyss</h1>
		<div class="box image">

		<div clas="box inner-content">
			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>The abyss is the dark multicolored area below the floor, showing colors ranging from dark blues to lighter ones.
			It's a long way down, so don't fall!</p>
			<h2>Tips:</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, the abyss will be dark gray and next to a floor.  Don't be fooled, you will still fall!  To avoid this, try to make
			sure the path you are taking is logical.</p>

		<h1>Falling Floor</h1>
		<div class="box image">
			<img src="../images/falling_floor.png">
		</div>
		<div class="box inner-content">
			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>Falling floors react to the player's touch.  Upon standing on a falling floor, all other falling floors will start to break.
			This is visible by the darkening of their color.  Once they are sufficiently broken, they will fall away, killing the player if
			standing on top of one.</p>
			<h2>Tips:</h2>
			<p>While falling floors are typically the same color as standard flooring, they are always the same shade as each other.  Try
			to find groups of them by looking for tiles with exactly the same colors.</p>

		<h1>Flame Thrower</h1>
		<div class="box image">
			<img src="../images/flame_thrower.png">
		</div>
		<div class="box inner-content">
			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>Flame Throwers are dangerous creations found in the game.  They expel fireballs at a standard interval.  While their projectiles
			are deadly to the touch, they are also, so beware!</p>
			<h2>Tips:</h2>
			<p>Flame Throwers always fire at a standard interval.  Use this to your advantage in making your way past them.</p>

	<div class="box content" id="ghost">
		<h1>Ghost</h1>
		<div class="box image">
			<img src="../images/ghost.png">
		</div>
		<div class="box inner-content">
			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>The ghost is a basic enemy type.  The ghost always moves in a defined path, and never strays from it.  Ghosts are not affected by falling tiles or hot tiles.
			Ghosts are deadly to the touch, and will kill the player if they collide.  Be careful of their tail, which is also deadly!</p>
			<h2>Tips:</h2>
			<p>At a certain interval, a ghost will pause in it's place.  Take advantage of this time and make a move!</p>

		<h1>Hot Tile</h1>
		<div class="box image">
			<img src="../images/hot_tile.png">
		</div>
		<div class="box inner-content">
			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>A hot tile looks similar to normal ground, but quickly heats up.  At it's apex, it will destroy the player!  Take care to not stand on it when it is hot,
			which is when it turns red almost like the player.  Hot tiles are typically found in groups, emulating a pattern.</p>
			<h2>Tips:</h2>
			<p>Try to study the tiles' pattern first before travelling over them.  This way, you can plot your route and try not to get burned.</p>
