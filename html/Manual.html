			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>The ghost is a basic enemy type.  The ghost always moves in a defined path, and never strays from it.  Ghosts are not affected by falling tiles or hot tiles.
			Ghosts are deadly to the touch, and will kill the player if they collide.  Be careful of their tail, which is also deadly!</p>
			<h2>Tips:</h2>
			<p>At a certain interval, a ghost will pause in it's place.  Take advantage of this time and make a move!</p>

		<h1>Hot Tile</h1>
		<div class="box inner-content">
			<h2>Information:</h2>
			<p>A hot tile looks similar to normal ground, but quickly heats up.  At it's apex, it will destroy the player!  Take care to not stand on it when it is hot,
			which is when it turns red almost like the player.  Hot tiles are typically found in groups, emulating a pattern.</p>
			<h2>Tips</h2>
			<p>Try to study the tiles' pattern first before travelling over them.  This way, you can plot your route and try not to get burned.</p>
